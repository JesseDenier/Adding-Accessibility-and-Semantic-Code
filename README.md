# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This is the first challenge of the UT Coding Bootcamp. It is designed to test my ability to add accessibility to websites while improving HTML and CSS to be semantic, logical, and follow DRY.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This webpage can be opened and scrolled. There is little to no interactivity but you can use a screen reader to have the images described to you.

## Credits

The vast majority of the code along with the images was not created or stylized by me. It was created by UT Coding Bootcamp, all I did was adjust the code to be more accessible, semantic, logical, and clean.
